External Backend Layouts
------------------------

Crystalis' Backend Layout File Data Provider allows you to outsource backend layouts as files, which increases 
flexibility and portability of your backend layouts. Every single layout is stored as a separate TypoScript file 
(\*.ts) and will be registered via PageTS.
