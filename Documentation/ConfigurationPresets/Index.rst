Configuration Presets
---------------------

Crystalis provides configuration presets which mainly optimize backend usability and HTML output. Most of them
automatically are injected by default, but some of them have to be activated individually.

This chapter describes which configurations are concerned in particular and how they integrate into your system. Please
keep in mind, that final configuration highly is affected by the extensions load order. If some extensions are loaded
after Crystalis, they may override parts of the provided configuration. However, in most cases this is the desired
behaviour and shouldn't irritate yourself.
