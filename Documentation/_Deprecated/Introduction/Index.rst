.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

Crystalis can be seen as a basic building block for websites. It supplies pure TypoScript content rendering, 
a slightly optimized backend, completely automatic language handling, HTML5 video element, various templates for 
third party extensions and many more.

It is subdivided into components which can be deactivated individually, thus your server will be burdened 
only with those parts you really need.

Because of the higher-than-average function range, this documentation is divided into those particular sections 
Crystalis provides. As a result you can easily skip those sections, you are not interested in.


.. _requirements:

System requirements
-------------------

At present Crystalis requires TYPO3 CMS 6.2 and PHP 5.4. Although not completely debarred, a compatibility layer 
is not being planned at the moment.
