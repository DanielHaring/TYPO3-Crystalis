Deactivating Language Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There may be situations where you don't want Crystalis to manage your language- and domain-configurations. Maybe you 
don't even need alternative languages or you want to write them on your own. To prevent Crystalis from calling the
Language Service, switch to *Extension Manager* module, select *Crystalis* and uncheck *"Activate"* inside *"Language 
handling"* tab.
