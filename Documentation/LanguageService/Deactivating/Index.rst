Deactivating Language Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There may be situations where you don't want Crystalis to manage your language- and domain-configurations. Maybe you 
don't even need alternative languages or you want to write your own configurations. To prevent Crystalis from calling 
Language Service, switch to Extension Manager module, select Crystalis and uncheck "Activate" inside "Language 
handling" tab.
