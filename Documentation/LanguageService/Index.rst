Language Service
----------------

Crystalis actively supports you in creating multilingual websites. Basically you just have to define available 
languages and domains â€“ the Language Service will take care about everything else.

To tap the full potential of this feature, it is highly recommended to install the third-party extension 
*RealUrl ("realurl")*. Crystalis will take care of configuring RealUrl depeding on available languages 
and domains. If you already are familiar with RealUrl and want to inject your own configurations, you can simply 
write your own base configuration and the Language Service will complete it with domain and language settings. 
If you're interested in how this exactly works, please see chapter :ref:`lang-custom-realurl`.
